### Advent of code 2024

Doing advent of code for fun and to get back in "c shape".

# Halfway update
This excercise degraded/upgraded into a "write everything yourself" challenge. It's very fun but also somewhat exhausting at times. I have managed my way through linked lists, hash tables and a bunch of loading/managing advent data stuff. There will be yoda notation.
